        <h1>Hi Angela Chi! This is my little special for you.</h1>
        <p>It had been nearly a year since we said goodbye, and I will never forget that moment. I just wanted to let you know that I really miss you and hope we can catch up soon. September 30th is your day of birth, so I have decided to make these special birthday presents for you. I hope you'll love them as much as I love making them hihi. I wish I could call you on that special day and wish you a “Happy Birthday”, but I hesitated, because I think talking through a phone is not down to earth at all, so I try to express through a digital letter. "Happy Birthday, Quan! I wish you a very happy birthday with your family and friends, filled with luck and success on your chosen path. And don't forget to take care of your health, always stay beautiful as an Angel." With all Love.</p>
